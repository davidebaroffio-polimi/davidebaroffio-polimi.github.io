**Research topics**: *Software-Implemented Hardware Fault-Tolerance, Compilers, Real-Time, Cybersecurity, Safety-critical systems.*

Davide Baroffio is a current research fellow at the *Department of Electronics, Information and Bio-engineering* (DEIB) of Politecnico di Milano. He earned his MSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering cum Laude in 2023 and his primary research focus is on the hardening of safety- and mission-critical systems through compiler-injected *Software-Implemented Hardware Fault Tolerance* (SIHFT). To this date, Davide has two published papers on this subject, one of which he presented at the *ACM International Conference on Computer Frontiers '23*. In addition to his core research, Davide actively collaborates on projects related to distributed computing, embedded systems, real-time operating systems, and computer security as part of partnerships between Politecnico and external companies. He is also a dedicated tutor for the *'Computer Science for Aerospace Engineering'* (Informatica per Aerospaziali) course, in which he supports Aerospace Engineering students by teaching the foundations of C programming.
